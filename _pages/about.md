### About Me

Hello! I'm Ravialdy Hidayat. I work with computers to make them smarter in understanding pictures and words. I've been doing this for over 3 years, both in companies and in a university.

#### What I Do

- **Current Role**: I am an AI Researcher at Vision-Language Intelligence at Sejong University in South Korea.
- **Skills**: 
  - **Computer Vision**: Making computers understand images and videos.
  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Helping computers understand and use human language.
  - **Machine Learning Computer Security**: Making sure our computer programs are safe from adversarial attacks with recent machine learning methods.

#### Where I Learned

- **University**: I got my degree in Statistics from Universitas Indonesia which is the best university in Indonesia according to #QS World University and Times Higher Education (THE) 2024 Rankings. My GPA was 3.52/4.00 (Top 10%, Cumlaude).
- **Special Courses**: I took a special Machine Learning course from Bangkit Academy. This course was led by Google and other big tech companies.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `my_profile.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
