### About Me

Hi! I'm Ravialdy Hidayat. I work in AI and Data Science. I've been doing this for over 3 years.

#### Work Experience
I started as a Data Scientist and then moved to AI research. Right now, I'm with Vision-Language Intelligence at Sejong University. We look at things like pictures (Computer Vision) and words (NLP) and how to make them safe (Computer Security).

#### Big Projects
I've worked on two big things:
- [ZOSignSGD Black-Box Attacks](https://github.com/ravialdy/ZOSignSGD-PyTorch)
- [PETL Black-Box Attacks Library](https://github.com/ravialdy/PETL-Attacks)

These are free to use and you can find them on GitHub.

#### How to Contact Me
The best way to talk to me is by [Email](mailto:ravialdyhidayat@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravialdy-hidayat-a617a8156/). You can also see more about my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/ravialdy).


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `my_profile.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
